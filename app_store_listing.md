## Description (4000 characters max)

**7 Journal is not a diary. It's a mental clearing system.**

Two daily check-ins. That's it.

**Morning — The 4 Block Journal**
Before your day begins, capture:
• What you feel
• What you need
• A truth and a lie you're telling yourself
• One action you'll take

**Night — The 3 Sentence Release**
Before you sleep, let go:
• What mattered today
• What you learned
• What you're releasing

---

**Why voice?**

Typing filters your thoughts. Speaking doesn't. 7 Journal uses voice-to-text to capture your raw truth, then AI formats it into clarity.
